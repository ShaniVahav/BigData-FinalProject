# Ice Creame Store
## about the project
_The goal of the project_ - to correctly predict in each store the amount of ice cream that will be sold on a certain day and the taste of the  
ice cream - individually and overall.  
  
The prediction is made by past data that we generated randomly with a bias towards many sales in big cities, weekends, holidays, etc., and few sales in small cities. 
In addition, there are sales "in real time" that are sent to the system via Kafka, you can visually see the sales inventory in each store in real time, the prediction for sales on a certain day and a map that maps all the cities where there is a branch.
